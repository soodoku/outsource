Sarah Palin is already picking out a job for herself in the forthcoming Donald Trump administration. She'd like to run the Department of Energy for a brief period, before abolishing it.

Sounds promising! Except for one tiny little catch — it's not clear she even knows what the department does. Here's what she told CNN:

"I think a lot about the Department of Energy, because energy is my baby: oil and gas and minerals, those things that God has dumped on this part of the Earth for mankind’s use instead of us relying on unfriendly foreign nations."

"I'd get rid of it. And I'd let the states start having more control over the lands that are within their boundaries and the people who are affected by the developments within their states. If I were in charge of that, it would be a short-term job, but it would be really great to have someone who knows energy and is pro-responsible development to be in charge."

Palin is talking about the fact that the federal government owns billions of acres of land and coastal waters, containing quite a bit of oil, gas, and coal. Industry groups have long complained that President Obama hasn't opened up nearly as much of this land to drilling as they'd like. And a few (fringe) groups out West have even demanded that this land be transferred to the states.

Except this really has nothing to do with the Department of Energy, which mainly oversees the nation's nuclear weapons program — a task consuming nearly half its budget — runs the national labs, and conducts energy R&D.

What Palin wants is the Department of Interior, which oversees the vast majority of federal lands. They're the ones handling leases for coal mining or fracking on public lands, through the Bureau of Land Management, or supervising offshore oil and gas drilling, through the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. If you wanted to devolve federal lands back to the states, you'd focus on Interior, not Energy.

Anyway, even if Palin did become Cabinet secretary, she couldn't just abolish a department on her own. That would require an act of Congress. But it sounds like Interior should be the agency she "thinks a lot" about.

Further reading:

-- Note that other conservatives have been pushing to abolish the Department of Energy over the years, which is probably where Palin got this idea. But the best arguments here usually center on streamlining bureaucracy, not whatever Palin's referring to. So it's worth asking anyone proposing abolition what they'd like to do with all the programs within the department (the naval nuclear propulsion program, nuclear weapons safety testing, the national research labs, and so on). Just to see if they know what they're talking about.

-- The Los Angeles Times recently ran a good piece on the mostly quixotic push in the West to return federal lands back to the states. One key line: "Legal and economic scholarship on Utah's transfer bill concludes that the federal land transfer is never going to happen, and if public lands were indeed somehow given to the states, the result would be a financial disaster."<form>

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., charged during a radio interview on Sunday that Hillary Clinton was “dishonest” during her testimony before a Senate hearing on Benghazi.

During the Benghazi hearing in March 2013, in response to a question from Paul, Clinton stated she did not know whether the U.S. mission in Libya was procuring or transferring weapons to Turkey and other Arab countries.

Clinton further asked Paul to inquire with the “agency” that ran the CIA Annex in Benghazi for more information.

Paul rehashed that exchange speaking Sunday on “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and Philadelphia’s NewsTalk 990 AM and online.

“The Clintons aren’t famous for revealing information. They are mostly famous for hiding information,” Paul scoffed.

The 2016 presidential contender continued: “And no. No information was ever revealed to me. But also in that exchange, she indicated that she had no knowledge of any of this going on. It wasn’t just that I should talk to the CIA. She indicated that she had no knowledge of this. And I believe that to be dishonest. I think she did have every bit of knowledge of what was going on.”

Paul told Klein he believes the U.S. collected weapons from Libyan jihadists and shipped them to Syrian rebels.

He stated: “And what I believe was happening is, there were 15,000 surface-to-air missiles. MANPADS that were missing after [Libyan leader Muammar] Gadhafi was toppled. Many of these went into the hands of radical jihadists. And this was one of the bad effects of Hillary’s war in Libya.”

“But the other thing they were doing is the weapons they could capture and get out of the hands of those in Libya they were turning around and sending them to jihadists in Syria. So it was a really foolhardy plan. And it continues to this day. You have people advising that we should be giving weapons to the allies of al-Qaida in Syria.”

Klein asked Paul whether he thinks Clinton should face legal consequences if it is alleged that she lied to lawmakers during the Benghazi hearing.

“I don’t think we should allow our public officials to lie in committee,” the senator replied. “James Clapper came to the senate and lied and said they weren’t collecting telephone records. Hillary Clinton comes and acts as if she didn’t have any idea what the CIA was doing in Libya. I think that was disingenuous at the very least.”

In the hearings over the Obama administration’s handling of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Paul asked Clinton: “Is the U.S. involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling, anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?”

“To Turkey?” Clinton asked. “I will have to take that question for the record. Nobody has ever raised that with me.”

Paul replied: “It’s been in news reports that ships have been leaving from Libya and that may have weapons, and what I’d like to know is the annex that was close by, were they involved with procuring, buying, selling, obtaining weapons, and were any of these weapons being transferred to other countries, any countries, Turkey included?”

Clinton shot back: “Well, Senator, you’ll have to direct that question to the agency that ran the annex. I will see what information is available.”

“You’re saying you don’t know?” asked Paul during the exchange.

“I do not know,” Clinton said. “I don’t have any information on that.”
