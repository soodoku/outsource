While Hillary Clinton’s email scandal continues to grow – currently 60 emails have been identified as containing classified data – another senior Obama administration official is being investigated for conducting government business from his private email account.

John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), does not want to provide the content of the emails in question, according to the free-market think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute.

The CEI filed a Freedom of Information Act request in October 2013 for policy emails Holdren kept on his private email account at his former employer, the environmental-pressure group Woods Hole Research Center.

OSTP turned down the FOIA request, claiming that Holdren’s private account was outside its control and therefore wasn’t subject to the FOIA. CEI filed a lawsuit in May 2014 to force OSTP to produce the emails, citing that the use of non-official accounts for agency business frustrates federal open-government laws, undermines government accountability and evades congressional oversight efforts.

In March 2015, a U.S. district court judge upheld the agency’s position, ruling the FOIA applied only to agency records controlled by the agency, and that Holdren’s private email account was off-limits.

In August, CEI filed the opening brief in an appeal. CEI argued that “FOIA applies to the work-related records of agency employees regardless of where they are stored, and that agencies routinely instruct their staff to preserve any such documents that they have on their personal email accounts. OSTP staff, perhaps, were reluctant to challenge their director’s private email practices, but that in no way makes the policy legal. Given the growing scandals over other top officials’ private emails, a reversal of the lower court’s ruling is essential to putting teeth into FOIA, especially in light of President Obama’s claim that his administration is the most transparent in history.”

CEI’s opening brief continued, “The court’s ruling on FOIA’s scope is plainly incorrect. The mere fact that emails are in a personal email account does not exempt them from FOIA, nor does it place them beyond an agency’s actual control for purposes of FOIA. Agencies frequently search the personal email accounts of agency employees for work-related records, demonstrating that agencies have actual control over those accounts.”

According to court documents, Holdren’s private email account was jholdren@whrc.org. He only had a private email account, not a private server like Clinton.

“It makes little sense to claim that an agency is not ‘withholding’ documents,” stated the opening brief, “when it refuses to produce documents held by its own chief executive that relate to ‘agency business.’”

Holdren’s case bears many similarities to Hillary Clinton’s case, whose reluctance to turn over her private email server to the FBI continues to cause headlines.

“[Clinton's] case is a prime example of a high official keeping a personal email account,” Sam Kazman, general counsel for the CEI, said in an interview with TheBlaze. “In our case, similarly, the official is claiming that not all of the messages in the personal account are subject to the Freedom of Information Act, even when in many cases they are clearly agency-related.”

Kazman said the Clinton matter has shed some light on what’s happening throughout the Obama administration where several White House officials – including Holdren as well as EPA officials – have sought to withhold communications.

“It’s not an atypical practice,” Kazman said. “I wouldn’t say it’s an everyday practice by everyone in the administration, but this White House pledged to be the most transparent administration in history. Our joke is when this administration says transparency they mean invisible.”

OSTP’s attempts to stall and evade the FOIA are “disturbing,” according to CEI senior attorney Hans Bader. In a May 5 blog post, he wrote: “OSTP first claimed that CEI lawyer Chris Horner’s FOIA request was not a FOIA request at all, even though it explicitly cited FOIA and FOIA statutory provisions and regulations. Then it interpreted Chris’s request as covering only certain emails already found in Holdren’s official OSTP email account. …

“The use of such non-official accounts for agency business frustrates federal open-government laws, and undermines government accountability, since such accounts are generally not searched in response to FOIA or congressional oversight requests seeking work-related communications or agency records. Moreover, the use of email accounts at a former employer that lobbies the federal government gives such pressure groups direct access to and control over public records, including highly sensitive information.”

The government has 30 days to respond, and the OSTP could ask for a delay. “They could produce documents,” Kazman said, “or at least withhold documents and provide an explanation.”

“What is ironic about this,” noted Bader, “is that OSTP’s Director, soon after taking office, lectured OSTP employees about not conducting official business using private email accounts, and about the need to forward all work-related communications to their agency email account in order to comply with federal record-keeping laws.”

Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee on Sunday sat down with ABC News's George Stephanopoulos for a tense exchange over Kim Davis.

Huckabee defended Davis, arguing that the Kentucky clerk should not be in jail after she stopped her office from issuing marriage licenses, as required by state law, due to her religious opposition to same-sex marriages. Huckabee made a lot of vivid comparisons throughout the discussion, invoking slavery, the Founding Fathers, Abraham Lincoln, and "judicial tyranny."

But then Huckabee made a more basic mistake, misunderstanding the legal rationale for one of the biggest Supreme Court decisions of the past few years. He asked, "When you say the federal government recognizes [same-sex marriage], what statute under which do they recognize it?"

There's a lot of philosophical debate about marriage equality and Davis. But at least to Huckabee's question, there's a very easy answer: the 14th Amendment.

The 14th Amendment prohibits discrimination

The 14th Amendment established that no group should be denied equal rights or protection under the law. So when it comes to marriage, same-sex couples can't be denied the same protections and rights guaranteed under federal and state marriage laws to other groups. This is the very foundation for the Supreme Court rulings that deemed federal and state bans on same-sex marriages to be unconstitutional. It is the statute that legalized same-sex marriages across the country.

Although the 147-year-old 14th Amendment was written at a time when the fight over same-sex marriage rights was far from the mainstream, legal scholars agree that it was purposely written in a broad manner to ensure that all groups — even those that the authors of the 14th Amendment couldn't envision — would be shielded from discrimination. So it's actually no accident that it's the basis today to protect same-sex couples from discrimination.

"The authors of the 14th Amendment rejected drafts and proposals that would have limited the 14th Amendment just to racial discrimination," Judith Schaeffer, vice president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, said in June. "Instead, they put in language that protects any person — not just on the basis of race, but any person."

The 14th Amendment has been used in marriage cases before: In Loving v. Virginia in 1967, the Supreme Court concluded that states' bans on interracial marriages discriminated against interracial couples and were therefore unconstitutional. Although Huckabee told Stephanopoulos that Loving v. Virginia was totally different, the legal rationale for it was the same as the decisions in the same-sex marriage cases: Just as interracial marriage bans violated interracial couples' rights under the 14th Amendment, so too did same-sex marriage bans violate same-sex couples' rights under the 14th Amendment.

The 14th Amendment is key in Kim Davis's case

 
The answer to Huckabee's question is important not just to sate the presidential candidate's curiosity but to the case of Davis in Kentucky as well.

When Davis decided earlier this year that she would stop her entire office (not just herself) from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, she did it in a way that actually acknowledged the 14th Amendment's importance to marriage equality: She prevented her office from issuing marriage licenses to anyone — both opposite-sex and same-sex couples. That way, she reasoned, she couldn't be accused of trying to discriminate — she wasn't just denying same-sex couples a right, but other couples, too.

But this placed Davis in conflict with Kentucky law, which requires that clerks issue marriage licenses. So when Davis forbade her office from issuing marriage licenses, ignored federal court orders that she issue marriage licenses, and said she would stop her deputy clerks from issuing marriage licenses if she was released from jail, she effectively forced US District Judge David Bunning to keep her in jail so the Rowan County clerk's office could conduct its legal duties without Davis's interference. That cascade of effects, originating from her attempts to bypass the 14th Amendment, is why she's in jail today.<form>
