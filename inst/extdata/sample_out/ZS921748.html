It was not easy, but Jeb Bush managed to find the two issues that Donald Trump is not utterly wrong and dangerous about, and attack him on those. Rather than go after Trump on his "viciously absurd" idea to depport 11 million undocumented immigrants and his persistent underlying racism and misogyny, Paul Krugman points out in Monday's column, that Bush is attacking the front runner on his stated willingness to raise taxes on the rich, and positive words about universal health care. That's sacrilege! 

"That tells you a lot about the dire state of the G.O.P.," Krugman writes. "For the issues the Bush campaign is using to attack its unexpected nemesis are precisely the issues on which Mr. Trump happens to be right, and the Republican establishment has been proved utterly wrong."

A little trip down recent memory lane demonstrates Krugman's point:

During the campaign, Mr. Romney accused President Obama of favoring redistribution of income from the rich to the poor, and the truth is that Mr. Obama’s re-election did mean a significant move in that direction. Taxes on the top 1 percent went up substantially in 2013, both because some of the Bush tax cuts were allowed to expire and because new taxes associated with Obamacare kicked in. And Obamacare itself, which provides a lot of aid to lower-income families, went into full effect at the beginning of 2014.

Conservatives were very clear about what would happen as a result. Raising taxes on “job creators,” they insisted, would destroy incentives. And they were absolutely certain that the Affordable Care Act would be a “job killer.”

So what actually happened? As of last month, the U.S. unemployment rate, which was 7.8 percent when Mr. Obama took office, had fallen to 5.1 percent. For the record, Mr. Romney promised during the campaign that he would get unemployment down to 6 percent by the end of 2016. Also for the record, the current unemployment rate is lower than it ever got under Ronald Reagan. And the main reason unemployment has fallen so much is job growth in the private sector, which has added more than seven million workers since the end of 2012.

Krugman hastens to add that, of course, all is not fantastic with the U.S. economy, what with wage stagnation and all.

Even more importantly, the columnist in no way endorses Trump. "He is exactly the ignorant blowhard he seems to be," he writes. It's just that when it comes to Trump's rivals, appearances are extremely deceiving. "Some of them may come across as reasonable and thoughtful, but in reality they are anything but."

Soft-spoken, bespectacled, bilingual Bush is a case in point. How anyone can believe he is a reasonable, responsible policy wonk is beyond comprehension. "His actual economic platform, which relies on the magic of tax cuts to deliver a doubling of America’s growth rate, is pure supply-side voodoo," Krugman writes.

Self-financing Trump has done the country a weird favor by further laying bare the influence of big-money donors, and proven that the base may not be buying the supply-side creed.

WASHINGTON — Donald Trump has a point when he talks about the need for immigrants to learn English.

“That’s how we assimilate,” he says. Which is true, as any visitor to Miami’s Little Havana has observed.

You can spend an entire day in this mostly Cuban section of the city and hear nary a word of English. Many never bothered to learn English because, mainly, they didn’t have to. They’ve gotten by just fine in their tiny nation within a city.

Nor, to Trump’s point, have they assimilated.

Such pockets doubtless exist elsewhere, especially in border states, and are likely to expand as more people come here illegally. To Trump and those he appeals to, these population trends pose an existential threat to the country. A nation divided by language is a nation divided.

Which is also true. But it is utterly ridiculous to insist that only English be spoken at all times. This was the implication from Trump’s latest jab at Jeb Bush, who recently answered questions in Spanish during a Miami news conference. The questions were asked in Spanish, so it must have seemed natural for Bush, who is bilingual, to respond in kind.

This is classic Trump. He sees his opponent’s positive and converts it to a negative. One of Bush’s trump cards is that he can speak directly to Hispanic voters who are crucial to winning the presidency. Thanks to Trump’s derogatory remarks about Mexicans and his deport-’em doctrine, his net favorability among Hispanic voters is minus-51 compared to Bush’s plus-11 (compared to Hillary Clinton’s plus-40!). This, despite the fact that Trump persists in reminding everyone that he employs thousands of Hispanics and “they love me!”

Rather than modify his message to include a smidgeon of empathy for people who come here looking for work, Trump figured out a way to diminish Bush’s advantage, or at least to rebrand it from Hey, a bilingual Republican nominee. Cool! to, “He should really set an example by speaking English while in the United States.”

Well, yeah. One should.

But as a bilingual person myself, I can’t express how grateful I am to my father who insisted I learn the language, telling me: “You’re going to need to know Spanish to survive in the world you’re going to inherit.”

Circumstances didn’t prove to be quite as urgent as he had imagined, but he was prescient about future demographics. As it turns out, I speak Spanish daily, which I enjoy for its own sake. But also I enjoy warm relationships with countless new Americans who haven’t yet mastered the predominant language and appreciate the gesture of respect. We connect on a level others can’t.

Giving Trump his due, we’re connecting because of our shared language. And, you can be sure, Bush and Marco Rubio are also connecting with those voters and reporters who address them in Spanish.

Trump knows full well how valuable bilingualism is in this country, especially when it comes to his own businesses. A 2014 job posting for one of his hotels said bilingualism was “preferred.” That’s just plain business sense — and Bush is merely brandishing his political sense.

Another positive-turned-negative is Bush’s “low energy,” a trait identified by Trump that others might recognize as maturity or calm. Trump is demonstrably high energy when it comes to talking loud and fast, which somehow in the past decade or so became conflated with being really, really smart. The motivating idea seems to be that super-smart people have to talk really fast to keep up with their super-fast brains. Tell that to the country lawyer.

Bush’s style isn’t exactly, say, electric, but he does have actual policies in his actual brain to back his campaign points. You may not like or agree with them, but at least there’s something there — a book on immigration, a legislative history on education, a longtime personal relationship with the Hispanic world. With Trump it’s all later, baby. Essentially, his motto is: Trust me, I can do this.

Trump is instinctively brilliant, however, as narcissists tend to be. He intuits what people want and gives it to them. When people say they like Trump because “He speaks his mind,” they really mean they like him because he speaks their mind.

Cuidado,amigos. Be careful what you think.

With Trump, you just might get it.<form>
